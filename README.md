# calculator

Things to improve:

1. Remove the NaN displays which occur in some instances e.g after +/- and then equals after more than twice.
2. Check all instances of exponential to ensure it is accurate. It was checked once, it does its basic functions. But it needs to be checked if there are no instances/buttoncombinaitons in which it gives NaN or errors.
3. Make sure +/- toggle works perfect under all button combinations.
4. Read through commented out code and delete/activate that which is necessary, especially that under evaluateEntireExpression().

5. Activate scientific div in html and add scientifc symbols and functions in js.
6. May need to update appearance of calc.
